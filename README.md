# You Don't Need To Know Web Development

## Why?

After mind-blowing popularity of the **you-dont-*** series of repositories on Github, I present to you - **You don't need to know Web Development**! Checkout some past repos in this series:

## What?

This repository tries to convince you that **you don't need to know Web Development**.

## How?

Good question. üòÅ Web Development is one of the fastest moving field in Computer Science (and otherwise). It is so fast that people in Web Development create problems so that they can create solutions for it. Its really hard to keep up with so many new things coming up every hour! If that was not enough, we have a whole range of browsers out there - each one trying to be best by being different from other üò≠

So why get into Web Development??? You could do so many other things instead:

### 1. Go into native mobile development

No browser. No JavaScript. No CSS. Do you need more reasons to switch to native mobile development? üòì Moreover, not much need to get into performance issues in every part of your app. Best part is you get to work with awesome programming languages like Java that are extremely wonderful to code in and get to play with (so many) actual mobile devices (and dimensions) to test your code.

The fun doesn't stop there. You get to bundle your apps into those awesome 90's style installable packages that your users download to get going with. Plus who can miss the fun in the waiting that you do to get your apps passed by the friendly marketplaces - totally NEAT, right?

### 2. Hire a developer for you

If you absolutely need to get something done for Web, hire a developer. There are so many good freelance websites out there like [Upwork (formerly Elance)](https://www.upwork.com), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.in) etc where in you can post your requirement, pay some gold and have what you want.

The process is great. You get exactly what you want in one go! Its as if the developer actually knows what and how you want the work done. Must try.

### 3. Pair up with a developer friend/founder

This is one of the best things you can do. Get someone convinced in your vision and team up with you. Transfer your thoughts into him so he/she can use his dev-powers to build a product just the way you pictured it in your dreams. Ofcourse you'll need to split up the product 50-50 (or so) with him, but how does it matter. You get a cool working finished product free without doing anything and you can now focus on more important things like thinking about what would you reward your users who become part of your referral system when your product launches in beta! üòç

### 4. Copy (be inspired by?) an existing thing

This one is lil tricky because even you copy an existing thing out there, you might want to change a color or two or use a new font altogether so the resemblance is minimum and no one knows where you got it from. Sure, you can take help from your developer friend for these changes. Easy üòÇ

### 5. Go out and play Pokemon GO!

Seriously, its fun! Try it.

Hope I am able to convince you to not get into Web Development.
